# Work item revision replay migration

> Obsolete - merged into WorkItemMigration

That is the working horse. This processor migrate all the work items. 
The process is different from `WorkItemMigrationConfig`. This process will create a work item step by step. So you get a clean history in the target project. 

> Note: only use this processor if you need a correct history on your work items. This processor is much slower then `WorkItemMigrationConfig` and don't have so much option to change the work item meta data. (CreatedDate, Createdby, BuildFieldTable, AppendMigrationToolSignatureFooter)

That should be run after the following pre processors.

* `NodeStructuresMigrationConfig`
* `TeamMigrationConfig`
