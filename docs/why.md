# Why use Azure DevOps Migration Tools
The main migration tool for TFS has always been the TFS Integration Tools which is sadly no longer supported. Indeed it only loosely supported versions of TFS after 2010 and had a lot of bugs. It was very difficult to configure and run. This tool hopes to solve some of that by providing support for TFS 2015 and Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS).

It solves:

 - Supports all currenlty supported version of TFS
 - Supports Azure DevOps Services
 - Migrates work items from one instace of TFS or Azure DevOps to another
 - Bulk edits fields in place for both TFS and Azure Devops Services
 - Being able to migrate Test Plans an Suits from one Team Project to another
 - Being able to migrate Teams from one Team Project to another
