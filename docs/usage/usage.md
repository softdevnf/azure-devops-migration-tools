# Usage

There are two main ways to consume VSTS Bulk Data Editor, the first is by running vstsbulkeditor.exe. The second is to create your own executable using the Nuget Package and consume the API directly.

 - [Using the Command Line tool](command-line.md)
 - [Using the NuGet Library package](nuget-library.md)
 
The recommendation would be to start with the [command line tool](command-line.md) and only use the API if absolutely necessary.
