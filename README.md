**VSTS Migrator**.

***These tools are built and maintained on VSTS for VSTS with full build and release integration. There is an automated process, built on Team Build, that synchronises code from here and protects the MASTER branch. This is all automated with Team Build and Release Management.***

VSTS Migrator is a set of migration tools for pushing data around in VSTS and TFS. You can move data between team projects, duplicate data, or do a full migration from one inctance of TFS/VSTS to another.
